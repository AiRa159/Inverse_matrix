# Ð¡alculator for calculating the inverse matrix (by Aiya Rakhimova)

## Description
The calculator calculates the inverse matrix of a square matrix of size NxN.
It is necessary to enter the data in the correct format to start.
The inverse matrix is found using a matrix of algebraic complements.
The program calculates pre-prepared examples in code and receives data from the console.

## Tutorial
### Application arguments:

[--help] - show instruction

[--start] - start counting inverse matrix

[--examples] - show prepared examples

[--end] - stop program

### Examples:

[--test1] - calculate inverse matrix of size 2x2

[--test2] - calculate inverse matrix of size 3x3

[--test3] - calculate inverse matrix of size 4x4

[--test4] - calculate inverse matrix of size 9x9

## Time 
The project does not use multithreading. The time is indicated in the console after the calculation is completed.
